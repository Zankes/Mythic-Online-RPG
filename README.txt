This is a RPG game, similar to Pokemon, still in development. All the pixel art were hand-drawn using Photoshop. The link will redirect you to
the JSFiddle page where you can try the game out! This is a fun project and everyone is more than welcome to help chime in some ideas or offer collaboration.
